     <b>Swimming</b>
     <p>One of my favourite sports is swimming because it is fun and requires a lot of energy to do. After my swimming
          class I feel motivated to continue work at home. Swimming is also a very good way to lose weight. </p>
     <b>Football</b>
     <p>For me, football is quite hard but it is still fun to play with friends. I don't have anything else to say about
          this sport cuz I am brain dead rn</p>
     <b>Captain ball</b>
     <p>Captain ball train brain to think more clearly and fast. Captain ball is very fun in my opinion, I like playing
          captain ball with my friends. </p>
     <b>Some kind of sport</b>
     <p>*Inserts description of sport* :D</p>
